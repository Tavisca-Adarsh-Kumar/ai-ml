Document Intelligence
---

- Support processing text and making sense of information in text.
- An extension of optical character recognition (OCR)
- It automates the process of extracting, understanding, and saving the data in text.
- Relies on machine learning models that are trained to recognize data in text.
- Separate machine learning models need to be trained to provide high quality results for different forms and documents.

## Azure AI Document Intelligence

### Features

- Document analysis
    - general document analysis that returns structured data representations, including regions of interest and their inter-relationships.
- Prebuilt models
    - pretrained models that have been built to process common document types such as invoices, business cards, ID documents, and more.
    - These models are designed to recognize and extract specific fields that are important for each document type.
- Custom models
    - can be trained to identify specific fields that are not included in the existing pretrained models.
    - Includes custom classification models and document field extraction models such as the custom generative AI model and custom neural model.
