 AI Fundamentals
 ---

- AI is software that `imitates human behaviors and capabilities`.

# Key AI Workloads:

## Machine learning

- This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we `"teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data`.

## Computer Vision

- Capabilities within AI to `interpret the world visually` through cameras, video, and images.
- An area of AI that deals with visual processing.

### Models & Capacilities

#### Image classification

- Classify images based on their content.
- Classify the type of vehicle like Car, Taxi, Bus, Cyclist etc
- Classify pets like Dog, Cat etc

#### Object detection

- Classify individual objects within an image and identify their location boundary box.

#### Semantic segmentation

- Individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong.
- For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors.

#### Image analysis

- Combine machine learning with image analysis to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.
- Eg: A person with a dog on the street

#### Face detection, analysis & recognition

- Specialized form of Object Detection that locates human faces in image.

#### Optical character rocognition (OCR)

- Detect and read text in image.
- Read text in photographs, or extract information from scanned document, invoice or forms.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Capabilities within AI for a computer to `interpret written or spoken language`, and respond in kind.

### Azure NLP Services

#### Azure AI Language

- Features:
    - Understanding and analyzing text
    - Training conversational language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands
    - Building intelligent applications
- Tool: Azure Language Studio

#### Azure AI Speech

- Features:
    - Speech recognition and synthesis
    - Real-time translations
    - Conversation transcriptions
- Tool: Azure Speech Studio

#### Azure AI Translator

- Features:
    - Translation, which analyzes the semantic context of the text and renders a more accurate and complete translation as a result.

## Document Intelligence

- Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
- Tool: Azure AI Document Intelligence Studio

## Knowledge Mining

- Capabilities within AI to `extract information` from large volumes of often `unstructured data` to create a searchable knowledge store.
- Tools: Azure AI Search

## Generative AI

- Capabilities within AI that `create original content` in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.
- Tools:
    - Azure OpenAI service
    - Azure AI Foundry

# Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

## Azure Machine Learning Studio 

### Automated Machine Learning

- Enables `non-experts` to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.

### Azure Machine Learning Designer

- A `graphical interface` enabling `no-code` development of machine learning solutions.

### Data Metric Visualization

- Analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
