Linear Regression
---

- Goal of linear regression is to minimize the vertical distance between all the data points and our line.
- Ways to minimize this distance:
    - Sum of squared errors
    - Sum of absolute erros
    - Sum of squares of residuals
    - Least squares method
- The `residuals` for an observation is the difference between observation (the -value) and the line.
