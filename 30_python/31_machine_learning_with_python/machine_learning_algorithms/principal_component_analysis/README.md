Principal Component Analysis
---

- aka factor analysis
- Unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying structure of those variables.
- Where regression determines a line of best fit to a data set, factory analysis determines several orthogonal lines of best fit to the data set.
- Orthogonal means "at right angles"
    - Actually the lines are perpendicular to each other in n-dimensional space.
- n-dimensional space is the variable sample space.
    - There are as many dimensions as there are variables, so in a data set with 4 variables the sample space is 4-dimensional.
- Components
    - Components are a linear transformation that chooses a variable system for the data set such that the greater variance of the data set comes to lie on the first axis.
    - Components are uncorrelated, since the sample space they are orthogonal to each other.
