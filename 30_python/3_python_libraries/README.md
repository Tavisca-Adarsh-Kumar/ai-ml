Opensource deep learning library developed by google. Large eco-system of components, including libraries like Tensorboard, deployment and production APIs and support for various programming languages. | High level python library that can use a variety of deep learning libraries underneath, such as TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano.
 Difficult to use. | Easy to use and builds model by simply adding layers on top of each other through simple calls.
